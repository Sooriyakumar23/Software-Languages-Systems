* 'Container' is the first thing we need to start with if we want to use the Bootstrap Grid System

    - container-fluid: No left or right margins
    - container-breakpoint
        - container-md
            - Above md:- act as container
            - Below md:- act as container-fluid
        - container-lg
            - above lg:- act as container
            - below lg:- act as container-fluid
        ............
    - container -> row -> column

* my => margin in y / vertical direction
* mx => margin in x / horizontal direction
